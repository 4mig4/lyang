Next:
   - Augment expansion
   - Expand 'include's also (submod) ?

Parser:
  - Handle: augment
  - Handle: namespace prefixed `uses` expansion (search + expand)

CLI:
 - Save the user entered data and either persist to file/DB
 - Add show: special commands to display current user entered data
 - Add show interim: to show scratchpad data (uncommitted)
 - Add commit to push/write to DB/file
 - Maybe instead of .cli we shud create a .yo (common obj format kinda?)
 - case statements - exclude [dynamically] those leafs belonging to different case
 - Validation** and storage
        - Create a data table, which will be similar in structure to CLI/schema
          but to hold instances of user entered data - this can also be
          persisted to files and read back
        - Handling when and must statements (when walking the data table)
        - Maybe something to convert XPath to LPath (our) ?

DB:
 - Pick one with pub-sub
